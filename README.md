# Zoo Animal Management System
Project for Managing and Tracking Animals in a Zoo Environment
This project is designed to deepen understanding of relational database concepts using SQL Oracle. It focuses on the following technical aspects:

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
Database Structure: The database is structured using an ER model that represents key entities such as animals, enclosures, and veterinary records, along with their relationships.
# Normalization
Normalized Schema: The database schema is normalized to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity across multiple tables.
# Animal Records
Detailed Animal Information: Each animal record includes essential details such as name, birthdate, diet type, and specific dietary requirements, including food type and quantity.
# Enclosure Management
Assignment of Animals to Enclosures: Animals are assigned to specific enclosures based on their type, with enclosures capable of housing annex structures.
# Veterinary Registry
Comprehensive Medical Histories: The system includes a veterinary module that records detailed medical histories for each animal, including operations, medications, and visit dates.
# Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to enhance proficiency in relational database design and implementation, focusing on efficient data management and retrieval within a zoo setting.
